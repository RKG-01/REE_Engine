# REE_Engine
A Game Framework for Roblox.

# Why?
I used to make games for the Roblox platform- I might've been 12, but I still remember the amount of extra effort it took to initialize every new (unfinished) project with basic tools.

## Cool, why is the repo empty, though?
I haven't made a Roblox project in a while, and things have changed... a lot. <br>
REE_Engine is also a hobby project, it's pretty low on my priority list- sorry.
